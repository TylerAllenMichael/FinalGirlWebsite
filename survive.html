          <h1>Rule 1: The body count is always higher.</h1>
          <h1>Rule 2: The death scenes are always much more elaborate. More blood, more gore.</h1>

          <h1>Rule 1: You got a killer who's going to be superhuman. Stabbing him won't work. Shooting him won't work. Basically in the third one you gotta cryogenically freeze his head, decapitate him, or blow him up.</h1>
          <h1>Rule 2: Anyone including the main character can die.</h1>

          <h1>Rule 4: Virgins can die now.</h1>
          <h1>Rule 5: New versions are always 2.0, so the latest technology is always involved and integral to the plot. This means the killer may start filming the murders.</h1>
          <h1>Rule 6: If you want to survive in a modern day horror movie, you pretty much have to be gay.</h1>
        </div>

          <h1>Rule 1: Never trust the love interest.</h1>
