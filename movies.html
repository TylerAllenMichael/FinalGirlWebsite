          <p>
            In a quiet town in California, Woodsboro became the center of a killing spree when a masked killer decided to show up. The main character, Sidney Prescott, had her mother murdered just a year before the new killings started up again.
            After the murders, Sidney and her friend group begin to be attacked one-by-one, and they have to find out who is murdering everyone before it is too late. They are haunted by a person wearing a white faced mask with a black robe and uses
            a knife to slash all the victims. Will Sidney survive the horror, or will she succumb to the evil that now rests within Woodsboro.

              (At around twelve minutes) At the beginning of the movie when Casey's (Drew Barrymore's) parents come home to find something is wrong, her father tells her mother to "go to the McKenzies'", which is the same thing Laurie (Jamie Lee
              Curtis) told Lindsey (Kyle Richards) and Tommy (Brian Andrews) to do in Halloween (1978), of which this movie contains many references. Courteney Cox approached the production to pursue the role. She was interested in playing a "bitch"
              character to offset her "nice" Friends (1994) image. This image was the main reason why the producers initially refused to consider Cox for the part. Cox continued to lobby the studio as she felt she could believably play the character.
              Her efforts ultimately succeeded. The use of caller ID increased more than threefold after the release of this film. The special effects artists used about fifty gallons of blood.

            The cast were not informed of the identity of the killer until the last day of principal photography. Also, the cast did not receive the last ten pages of the shooting script until it was time to film the scenes contained therein.
            Furthermore, the last ten pages of the shooting script were printed on gray paper in order to deter illicit duplication of them. All cast members were required to sign confidentiality clauses as parts of their respective contracts that
            precluded them from discussing the outcome of the story and the killer's identity. (At around thirteen minutes) Like in the first film, you can find a reference to Freddy Krueger's (played by Robert Englund in the A Nightmare on Elm
            Street franchise) iconic sweater in Hallie's (Elise Neal's) and Sidney's (Neve Campbell's) dorm room in the beginning of the film hanging on their closet door. Various titles were considered for the sequel at different points in the
            film's production, including Scream Again, Scream Louder, and Scream: The Sequel.

            The third installation of Scream follows Sidney Prescott in Hollywood at the set of the “Stab 3” film. Both Gale and Dewey come to the film set with Sidney only to be the target of another Ghostface killer. The “Stab 3” film actors are
            playing the original characters, and the way they die in the screenplay is the way the killer is murdering them in real life. Now, Sidney is faced with a whole new terror and is trying to survive until the masked killer is revealed or
            dead.

            Patrick Dempsey was hired the day before shooting began. He had one night to learn three big dialogue-heavy scenes. David Arquette and Courteney Cox met on the set of Scream (1996), dated while shooting Scream 2 (1997), and married a
            month before principal photography of this movie began. They cut short their honeymoon in order to film it. Cox added "Arquette" to her name, as seen in the credits. The house used during the climax, where most of the killing takes place,
            is the same house used as a school in Halloween h30: 20 Years Later (1998). Throughout the film, Sidney (Neve Campbell) can be seen wearing the Greek letters around her neck that were given to her by her boyfriend Derek (Jerry O'Connell)
            in Scream 2 (1997), shortly before he was killed.

          <h3>Trivia</h3>
          <p>
            Last film directed by Wes Craven before he died from brain cancer on August 30, 2015, at the age of seventy-six. At four installments, this initially land marked the Scream franchise as being one of the only horror franchises to have both
            its main characters as well as its director (Wes Craven) return for all of its sequels, until the release of Scream (2022), which features a new director(s) as a result of Craven's death. As seen in the gag reel, there was an on-going
            prank on-set where somebody dressed in the Ghostface mask would jump out and scare an actor or actress at a time when Ghostface wasn't scripted to appear. For example, an actor or actress would open a door expecting nobody to be behind
            it, and instead somebody in the mask would jump out. In at least one instance, this prank was pulled on an actress during a scene where she was scripted to be chased by a killer, rounded a corner and met an unscripted appearance by
            Ghostface.

            peaceful town of Woodsboro. Ghostface returns and begins targeting a new group of teenagers to bring the past into present. The killer has one goal and Ghostface will not stop until they expose the truth that happened so many years ago.

          <p>
            The fact that Dewey never mentioned his sister Tatum or her death was an oft-criticized aspect of the prior sequels, making it seem like she had been forgotten. Here, we see that he still keeps her ashes on the mantle. While Richie is
            watching a YouTube video about Stab 8, one of the thumbnail recommendations beside it is an interview with Woodsboro survivor Kirby Reed played by Hayden Panettiere in Scream 4 (2011). Sidney's line in the film "I'm Sidney fucking
            Prescott, of course I have a gun" was Neve Campbell's idea to include. Neve Campbell was initially hesitant to return to the franchise, especially in a new Scream film that didn't feature Wes Craven as director, who would be unable to
            give Campbell and the new directors his blessing due to his death. What changed her mind was a letter sent to her by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, where they wrote about how much Wes Craven and his films meant to them as
            filmmakers.
